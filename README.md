## 🌟 Overview

**LBPO-Studio (Layer-Based Prompt Optimizer Studio)**  
is an intelligent system that helps users **define**, **test**, and **optimize** prompts for large language models (LLMs).

The core mechanism: **you write your own task instructions and test cases**.  
Based on these, the system **searches**, **tests**, and **optimizes** prompts, improving model performance on your cases.

Goal: **let the model automatically approach the “ideal output” you define.**

## ⚙️ Core Mechanism

| Step | Description |
|:---:|---|
| 1️⃣ | **User Input** — Users write task instructions and test cases. |
| 2️⃣ | **Automatic Search** — The system explores multiple prompt candidates. |
| 3️⃣ | **Evaluation & Testing** — Each prompt is tested on your defined cases. |
| 4️⃣ | **Optimization** — LBPO-Studio refines prompts based on test performance. |
| 5️⃣ | **Ideal Output Alignment** — The model approaches your defined “ideal output.” |

## 💡 Key Features

- 🧩 **Custom Task & Test Design** — Define your own tasks and evaluation metrics.  
- 🔍 **Automated Prompt Search & Evaluation** — Iteratively find better prompt wordings.  
- 🧠 **Performance-Driven Optimization** — Each iteration is scored and improved based on real test results.  
- 🎯 **Outcome Alignment** — The model learns to match your **ideal output**.  
- 🌐 **Multi-Language Interface** — Supports English, Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean, etc.

## 🚀 Vision

LBPO-Studio introduces a new paradigm of **Outcome-First Prompt Engineering**.  
It replaces intuition-based prompt crafting with a **quantitative optimization loop** among prompts, tests, and model performance.
